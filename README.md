# **Java/Scala Test**

Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation) for money
transfers between accounts.

Explicit requirements:

1. keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication, assume the APi is
invoked by another internal system/service)
2. use whatever frameworks/libraries you like (except Spring, sorry!) but don't forget about the
requirement #1
3. the datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test
4. the final result should be executable as a standalone program (should not require a pre-installed
container/server)
5. demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected

Implicit requirements:

1. the code produced by you is expected to be of high quality.
2. there are no detailed requirements, use common sense.
